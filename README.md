# dmfb-env
An OpenAI Gym-based environment for digital microfluidic biochips (DMFBs).

## Overview
This environment simulates the degradation process of electrodes in DMFBs. For furhter information, please reference our ICML'20 paper named "Adaptive Droplet Routing in Digital Microfluidic Biochips Using Deep Reinforcement Learning".

## Training
TBD
